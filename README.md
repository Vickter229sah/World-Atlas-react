# 🌍World Atlas React Project
The World Atlas React project is a web application built with React.js that allows users to explore information about different countries across the world. It provides functionalities like searching for countries, filtering them by regions, and sorting them in ascending or descending order. The app fetches data using Axios from a public API, ensuring that the data is dynamic and up-to-date.
